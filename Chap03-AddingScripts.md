# Adding Scripts

So, what other changes are required in the game?

Try playing the game after cloning it from the repository, you can see that the player can move, jump and pick up keys but when the player touches the enemy nothing happens right?

First, we need to create a function that does something, in this case, reduce the life by one and then trigger the death or GameOver UI when all 3 lives are lost.

Here is a sample script that does this:

```
    public void KillPlayer()
    {
        player_health--;
        if (player_health == 2)
        {
            player_animator.SetTrigger("Hurt");
            life_three.SetActive(false);
        }
        else if (player_health == 1)
        {
            player_animator.SetTrigger("Hurt");
            life_two.SetActive(false);
        }
        else
        {
            player_animator.SetTrigger("Death");
            life_one.SetActive(false);
            player_gameover.GameOver();
            this.enabled = false;
        }
    }
```

What the above function does is, checks for the value of the player_health variable, then sets is active or inactive based on that value. The final else condition in the function also calls teh GameOver() function since after 3 lives, the player needs to die and the GameOver UI Canvas becomes active. Another trigger is for the respective animation that needs to be played, for example, the player getting hurt.

Then, once the function created, all we need to do is trigger this function when the enemy collides with the player.

Here is an example how this can be implemented:

![EnemyCollision](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44625252/155331606-8ae5ca54-54ad-424a-9732-ae0c671e233f.png)

In the above function, we can see that OnCollisionEnter2D function (from Monobehaviour) is called whenever both the colliders touch each other. Then this calls the function KillPlayer() which we had created above. Think of this like a function that is calling another function. In any programming language, this is a common practice that creates easily readable code.

And thats it!

Think where you need to add these script changes from among the script files.
